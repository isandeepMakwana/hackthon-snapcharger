# UI/UX Audit

## Key Findings (Before)

- Driver experience relied on dense UI blocks with minimal hierarchy and limited spacing.
- Several interactive controls lacked labels, keyboard focus, or clear status states.
- Map and booking flows were visually impressive but not accessible to screen readers.
- Typography relied on generic UI fonts and lacked brand distinction.

## Enhancements Implemented

- Introduced a **design system** with brand tokens, consistent typography, and richer backgrounds.
- Simplified navigation with a **segmented role toggle** and clearer header metadata.
- Added **accessible dialogs** and keyboard dismissal for modal interactions.
- Refined **information architecture**: driver filters, results count, and quick actions are now grouped logically.
- Added subtle **motion cues** for list entries and modal transitions while honoring reduced motion.

## Outstanding UX Opportunities

- Add a booking timeline and slot picker with duration estimation.
- Provide onboarding tips for first-time hosts and drivers.
- Introduce inline validation and field-level help in the station form.
- Explore map clustering and list/map synchronization on large datasets.
